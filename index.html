          <p>
            There's a thread that runs through everything I've done: I get hired into roles that don't fully exist yet, and I build the systems that make them real. At Planning Center, I went from frontline support agent to their first automation engineer, architecting testing infrastructure, creating internal tools, and eventually representing the company at conferences and in partnerships with Apple and Stripe. There was no playbook, so I wrote one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I spent five years at Arise equipping instructors across programs for major Fortune 500 clients. I built a data tool that predicted which learners were at risk of failing, and it moved certification rates up by 35%. I've managed teams of 75+, designed curriculum from scratch, coached people through career transitions, and led quality programs across entire organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            And before any of that, I spent a decade in ministry, producing services, leading creative teams, and managing technology for churches. That's where I fell in love with the idea that nonprofits and churches deserve world-class tools. It's what drives every side project I build today.
